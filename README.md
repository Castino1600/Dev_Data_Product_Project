Developing Data Product Project 1
========================


This is the repository where I upload my work for Developing Data Products Project assignment 1: 

In this repo, you will find
* Programs to support my application: ui.R & server.R
* Markdown files
* Rstudio Presentation
* Readme file

The shiny application developed is a Celsius to Faranheit converter. You just need to plug in the insert the temperature in Faranheit or click and submit to get the temperature returned in Celsius or Faranheit.

The Rstudio Presentation described the motivation and the developing process for this App. Also, we showed some simulation results with a sample dataset to demonstrate and validate the App. 

You might need to manually download ui.R & server.R to run the App and download the Rstudio Presentation file to view the presentation. My company's networking setting frustrated me a lot and sorry for the inconvenience in advance!!
